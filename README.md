# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of the Analysis
###### The purpose of this project was to create an earthquake map with multiple maps and earthquake overlays. There are three map bases, streets, satellite, and dark. The three overlays include earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes (magnitude greater than 4.5). The size and color of the circle markers is relative to the earthquake. For example, a smaller light green marker indicates an earthquake with a magnitude between 0-2, whereas a red, larger marker represents an earthquake of a magnitude greater than 5. The legend in the bottom right corner can be used as a reference. A popup was also binded to the markers so when you hover over, you can see the magnitude and location of the earthquake that marker represents. 

###### This analysis was created using Javascript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The map was created using Mapbox and the leaflet library.
